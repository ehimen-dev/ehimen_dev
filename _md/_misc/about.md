> *What I build, Problems I've solved, that's the idea at least...*

![Owens Ehimen](/assets/blog/about/profile_image.jpg "Owens Ehimen")

My name is Owens Ehimen,  I am a software developer based in Toronto, and I have a confession to make: As of this writing, I haven't *built* anything. 

To be fair to myself, I have contributed to software projects, worked professionally as a developer for 2 years, and I can *talk all day* about how to use various design patterns in Java or how to organize code. However, there is a non-fungible experience that comes from **building a project from A -> Z** that I don't believe I have experience doing (as of this writing).

Therefore, the purpose of building this blog is to write about **<u>what I have built</u>** and [showcase](/showcase) these projects whenever possible. This blog serves as a builder's journal, so I can confidently say that all the posts on this blog solely relate to my learnings working with a specific technology or concept. To be more specific:

* I will **<u>ONLY</u>** be writing about what **I built**, how **I built it** and my motivations for **building it**. This blog is solely for problems I've solved and what I've built.

  

* I will **<u>NOT</u>** be writing about any specific framework or technology. I will instead be talking about holistic software solutions to problems, or software business ideas that typically involve every level in a software stack (front-end, back-end, database, and even AI or ML techniques).

* I will **<u>NOT</u>** be writing about myself and my personal life.

Thanks for being here! Take a look at some of these experiences below:
